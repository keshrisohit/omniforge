# Glossary for Summarizing Tweets
=====================================

This glossary provides key terms and definitions related to summarizing tweets. It is organized alphabetically and includes cross-references to other relevant terms.

### A
* **Algorithm**: A set of instructions used to summarize tweets, such as natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning (ML) techniques. See also: [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
* **API**: Application Programming Interface, used to access tweet data from platforms like Twitter. Example: `{baseDir}/twitter_api.py`

### C
* **Classification**: The process of categorizing tweets into different topics or themes. See also: [Clustering](#clustering)
* **Clustering**: A technique used to group similar tweets together based on their content. Example: `{baseDir}/clustering_example.ipynb`

### D
* **Data Preprocessing**: The step of cleaning and preparing tweet data for summarization, including tokenization and stopword removal. See also: [Tokenization](#tokenization)

### K
* **Keyword Extraction**: The process of identifying the most important words or phrases in a tweet. Example: `{baseDir}/keyword_extraction.py`

### M
* **Machine Learning**: A type of algorithm used to train models for tweet summarization. See also: [Algorithm](#algorithm)
* **Model Evaluation**: The process of assessing the performance of a summarization model using metrics such as precision and recall. Example: `{baseDir}/model_evaluation.ipynb`

### N
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of study focused on the interaction between computers and human language, used in tweet summarization. See also: [Tokenization](#tokenization)

### S
* **Summarization**: The process of condensing a large amount of tweet data into a shorter, more meaningful summary. See also: [Algorithm](#algorithm)
* **Stopword Removal**: The step of removing common words like "the" and "and" from tweet data. See also: [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing)

### T
* **Tokenization**: The process of breaking down tweet text into individual words or tokens. Example: `{baseDir}/tokenization_example.py`
* **Tweet**: A short message posted on a social media platform like Twitter. See also: [Summarization](#summarization)
