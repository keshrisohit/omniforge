# Code Review Style Guide

## Purpose
This style guide provides a framework for conducting effective and consistent code reviews. It aims to improve code quality, facilitate knowledge sharing, and maintain project standards.

## Principles
- Be constructive and respectful
- Focus on the code, not the author
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications

## Review Process
1. **Preparation**
   - Familiarize yourself with the project's coding standards
   - Understand the purpose and scope of the changes
   - Review any associated documentation or requirements

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Check if the code meets the acceptance criteria
   - Verify that tests are included and passing
   - Ensure the code is well-documented

3. **Detailed Review**
   - **Functionality**
     - Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
     - Are there any edge cases not handled?
   - **Design**
     - Is the code modular and maintainable?
     - Are there any unnecessary dependencies?
   - **Readability**
     - Is the code easy to understand?
     - Are variable and function names descriptive?
   - **Efficiency**
     - Is the code optimized for performance?
     - Are there any potential bottlenecks?

4. **Feedback**
   - Provide clear, concise comments
   - Use a consistent tone and format
   - Prioritize issues (e.g., must fix, should improve, nice to have)

5. **Follow-up**
   - Be available to discuss your feedback
   - Re-review changes if necessary
   - Approve the code when all issues are resolved

## Checklist

## Tools and Resources
- [Code Review Tools](link)
- [Project Coding Standards](link)
- [Security Guidelines](link)

## Escalation Process
If you encounter issues that cannot be resolved through the standard review process, escalate to:
- Team Lead
- Project Manager
- Security Team (for security-related concerns)

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update this style guide
- Conduct review retrospectives
- Share best practices within the team
