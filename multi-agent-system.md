# Multi-Agent Systems

A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computational system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These agents can be software entities, robots, or humans that work together to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent to solve alone.

## Key Concepts

### Agents
- **Autonomous**: Operate without direct human intervention
- **Social**: Interact with other agents
- **Reactive**: Respond to environmental changes
- **Proactive**: Take initiative to achieve goals

### Agent Types
- **Collaborative agents**: Work together toward common goals
- **Competitive agents**: Compete for resources or objectives
- **Hybrid agents**: Combine collaborative and competitive behaviors

## Architecture

### Communication
- Message passing protocols
- Agent communication languages (ACL)
- Coordination mechanisms

### Coordination
- Task allocation
- Resource sharing
- Conflict resolution

## Applications

- Distributed problem solving
- Swarm robotics
- Traffic management systems
- Supply chain optimization
- Multi-robot systems

## Benefits

- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Adaptability

## Challenges

- Agent heterogeneity
- Communication overhead
- Coordination complexity
- Security concerns

## Frameworks

Popular multi-agent system frameworks include:
- JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)
- AgentSpeak
- Jason
- MadKit
- Repast

## Future Directions

- Integration with AI/ML
- Blockchain-based agent systems
- Edge computing with multi-agent coordination
- Human-agent teaming
